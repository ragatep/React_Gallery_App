Teamtreehouse - Project 7<br />
React Gallery App

Hello Internet.

I created this image library gallery app to demonstrate my knowledge of the best practices of working with React. Like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in my project JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. The app uses Axios to fetch data from Flickr API and display images.

Happy searching!
